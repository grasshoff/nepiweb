## Overview {.unnumbered}

This research pioneers a comprehensive approach to enhance the metadata of historical scientific texts and conduct diachronic analyses of chemical knowledge. Presented by Diego Alves, Sergei Bagdasarov, and Badr Abdullah, this initiative addresses the inherent challenges of managing extensive historical corpora.

Our project unfolds in two distinct phases. Initially, we leverage *Large Language Models (LLMs)* to refine text metadata, focusing on article categorisation by scientific discipline, semantic tagging, and abstractive summarisation. Subsequently, the work delves into a detailed case study, meticulously analysing the evolution of chemical discourse across various disciplines over time. This second phase specifically identifies periods of heightened interdisciplinarity and knowledge transfer, employing advanced computational methods.

The *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London*, a foundational and continuously published scientific journal spanning over three centuries, serves as the primary data source. This rich historical context underpins our innovative research.

## Research Objectives and Scope

![Slide 01](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_01.jpg)

This research systematically explores the application of *Large Language Models (LLMs)* for enhancing historical scientific texts. Our project, titled "Leveraging Large Language Models for Metadata Enrichment and Diachronic Analysis of Chemical Knowledge in Historical Scientific Texts," unfolds in two principal parts.

The first part focuses on deploying *LLMs* to improve the metadata associated with historical texts. This involves the precise categorisation of articles according to their scientific discipline, the assignment of pertinent semantic tags or topics, and the generation of concise, abstractive summaries.

Building upon this metadata enrichment, the second part undertakes a detailed analysis of the chemical space as it evolved across different scientific disciplines over time. A crucial objective here involves identifying specific periods that correspond to peaks of interdisciplinarity and significant knowledge transfer, thereby illuminating the dynamic nature of scientific discourse.

## Historical Scientific Corpus: Philosophical Transactions

![Slide 01](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_01.jpg)

This project investigates the evolution of scientific English, alongside phenomena such as knowledge transfer and the identification of influential papers and authors. Central to this inquiry is the *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London*, a corpus of unparalleled historical significance.

First published in 1665, this journal holds the distinction of being the oldest scientific periodical in continuous publication, maintaining a high reputation to this day. It played a pivotal role in shaping scientific communication, notably by establishing the practice of peer-reviewed paper publication as a primary means for disseminating scientific knowledge. The corpus contains numerous seminal contributions, including Isaac Newton's "New Theory about Light and Colours" from the 17th century, Benjamin Franklin's "The 'Philadelphia Experiment' (the Electrical Kite)" from the 18th century, and James Clerk Maxwell's "On the Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field" from the 19th century. Beyond these renowned works, the collection also features more curious, speculative texts, such as discussions on lunar inhabitants, though our research focuses on linguistic and thematic analysis rather than factual validation.

For our analysis, we utilise the latest version of this extensive collection, the RSC 6.0 full corpus. This dataset spans over 300 years of scientific communication, from 1665 to 1996, encompassing nearly 48,000 texts and approximately 300 million tokens. While the corpus includes pre-encoded metadata, such as author, century, year, and volume, a previous study employed *LDA topic modelling* to infer research field categories. However, this earlier classification often conflated distinct scientific disciplines, sub-disciplines, and even text types, such as "observations" and "reporting." This necessitated a more refined approach to metadata enrichment, which our current work addresses.

## Large Language Models for Metadata Enrichment

![Slide 10](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_10.jpg)

To address the limitations of existing metadata, we leveraged *Large Language Models (LLMs)* for comprehensive metadata enrichment. These models offer diverse applications, including text clean-up, summarisation, information extraction, and the populating of knowledge graphs, alongside their core function in categorisation and facilitating access and retrieval.

Specifically, we tasked the *LLM* with four distinct operations. First, it performed hierarchical categorisation, assigning both a primary discipline and a suitable sub-discipline to each article. Second, it identified key index terms, functioning as semantic tags or topics. Third, the model generated concise *TL;DR* (Too Long; Didn't Read) summaries, typically 3-4 sentences in length, designed to capture the essence and main findings of an article in simple language, accessible even to a high school student. Finally, the *LLM* proposed alternative, more reflective titles for the texts.

For this task, our team selected *Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B*, an 8-billion-parameter model from the *Llama 3* family. This particular variant, readily available on Hugging Face, demonstrated superior performance compared to *Mistral* and *Llama 2*. It had undergone instruction-tuning specifically for producing structured outputs in formats such as *JSON* and *YAML*.

A meticulously crafted system prompt guided the *LLM*'s operations. The prompt first defined the model's role: "Act as a librarian and organize a collection of historical scientific articles from the Royal Society of London, published between 1665 and 1996." It then articulated the objective: "read, analyze, and organize a large corpus... create a comprehensive and structured database that facilitates search, retrieval, and analysis..." The input was described as *OCR*-extracted text from original articles, accompanied by existing metadata including title, author(s), publication date, journal, and a short text snippet.

The prompt detailed the four specific tasks as follows:
A. Read and analyse the provided article to understand its content and context, then suggest an alternative title that better reflects its content.
B. Write a short 3-4 sentence *TL;DR* summary that captures the article's essence and main findings, ensuring conciseness, informativeness, and simple language.
C. Identify exactly five main topics, conceptualised as Wikipedia Keywords for categorising the text into scientific sub-fields.
D. Given the extracted topics, identify the primary scientific discipline from a predefined list (Physics, Chemistry, Environmental & Earth Sciences, Astronomy, Biology & Life Sciences, Medicine & Health Sciences, Mathematics & Statistics, Engineering & Technology, Social Sciences & Humanities) and a suitable second-level sub-discipline, with the crucial constraint that the sub-discipline could not be one of the primary disciplines.

An example input, Isaac Newton's 1672 letter, clearly illustrated the expected *YAML* output. The *LLM* successfully transformed the original lengthy title into "A New Theory of Light and Colours," assigned topics such as "Optics" and "Refraction," generated a concise *TL;DR* summary, and accurately classified the article under "Physics" with the sub-discipline "Optics & Light." A final instruction reinforced the requirement for a valid *YAML* output, with no additional text.

## LLM Performance and Diachronic Corpus Analysis

![Slide 15](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_15.jpg)

Initial sanity checks on the *LLM*'s performance yielded highly encouraging results. A remarkable 99.81% of the generated outputs, specifically 17,486 out of 17,520, conformed to the specified *YAML* format, demonstrating the model's proficiency in structured data generation. Furthermore, 94% of the predicted scientific disciplines aligned precisely with our predefined set of nine categories.

Nevertheless, the *LLM* exhibited some minor deviations or "hallucinations." For instance, it occasionally rendered "Earth Sciences" instead of the full "Environmental & Earth Sciences." The model also innovated novel categories, such as "Music," and sometimes incorporated the numerical index of a discipline directly into its name, for example, "3. Chemistry." Moreover, certain sub-disciplines, like "neurology" and "zoology," were incorrectly classified as primary disciplines. Despite these minor deviations, the *LLM* accurately assigned the vast majority of papers to their correct categories.

Leveraging this enhanced metadata, we conducted a diachronic analysis of the *Royal Society* articles, examining their distribution across disciplines over time. Before the close of the 18th century, the distribution of articles across disciplines appeared relatively homogeneous. However, the late 18th century witnessed a distinct surge in chemical articles, a phenomenon directly correlating with the Chemical Revolution. Subsequently, from the 19th century into the 20th, Chemistry, alongside Biology and Physics, emerged as one of the *Royal Society*'s primary pillars of scientific inquiry.

Further analysis involved visualising the *TL;DR* summaries using *t-SNE projections*, a dimensionality reduction technique. This revealed significant overlaps between Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, with Chemistry often situated centrally within this interdisciplinary space. Conversely, Humanities, Astronomy, and Mathematics formed more isolated clusters within the projection. This visualisation technique holds considerable promise for future research, enabling the detailed observation of diachronic shifts and evolving overlaps between disciplines.

## Diachronic Analysis of Chemical Space

![Slide 19](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_19.jpg)

Building upon the *LLM*-derived classifications, we proceeded with a diachronic analysis of the chemical space, focusing specifically on Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, given their prevalence within the corpus.

To extract chemical terms, our team employed *ChemDataExtractor*, a Python module designed for the automatic identification of chemical substances. Initial application of this tool to the entire text corpus generated considerable noise. Consequently, we adopted a refined approach: *ChemDataExtractor* was subsequently applied to a pre-filtered list of *extracted substances*, a method that significantly reduced the noisy output and improved precision.

For analysing the chemical space, we utilised *Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)*. This statistical measure quantifies the number of additional bits required to encode a dataset A when an (often sub-optimal) model based on dataset B is employed. Crucially, higher *KLD* values indicate greater differences between datasets, whilst lower values suggest relative similarity. In essence, *KLD* helps us understand how much one probability distribution differs from another.

We applied *KLD* in two distinct ways. First, to trace the independent evolution of the chemical space within each discipline along the historical timeline, we compared 20-year periods *before* a specific date with 20-year periods *after* it, employing a sliding 5-year window. This technique allowed for a granular understanding of how chemical terminology and concepts shifted within Chemistry, Biology, and Physics individually. Second, for a broader interdisciplinary perspective, we conducted a pairwise comparison of Chemistry with Physics and Chemistry with Biology, based on 50-year periods.

## Kullback-Leibler Divergence Results and Interdisciplinary Dynamics

![Slide 22](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_22.jpg)

Analysis of the *Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)* per discipline revealed consistent trends across Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, with peaks and troughs in *KLD* values occurring roughly concurrently. Towards the end of the timeline, the *KLD* generally decreased, indicating less variation between future and past periods within each discipline. A notable peak emerged in the late 18th century, prompting further investigation into the specific chemical substances driving this change.

Examining the period from 1776 to 1816, corresponding to the late 18th-century peak, we observed that in both Biology and Physics, one or two elements exhibited exceptionally high *KLD* values, effectively driving the observed shifts. Intriguingly, the same core chemical elements appeared across Chemistry, Biology, and Physics during this era, suggesting a shared foundational chemical vocabulary.

However, a significant divergence became apparent when analysing the second half of the 19th century (1856-1906). During this period, the *KLD* graphs for Biology and Physics became considerably more populated, with individual elemental contributions showing greater uniformity. Biology's chemical discourse evolved distinctly towards biochemistry, incorporating substances related to biochemical processes. Conversely, Chemistry and Physics increasingly focused on noble gases and radioactive elements, reflecting their discovery and burgeoning importance in the late 19th century.

Interdisciplinary comparisons, visualised through word clouds for the latter half of the 20th century, further elucidated these thematic differences. In the comparison between Chemistry and Biology, the biological word cloud featured a greater prevalence of substances associated with biochemical processes in living organisms. In contrast, the chemical word cloud highlighted substances pertinent to organic chemistry, such as hydrocarbons and benzene. When comparing Chemistry with Physics, the latter's word cloud prominently displayed metals, noble gases, rare earth metals, semi-metals, and radioactive metals, underscoring distinct disciplinary thematic focuses.

Crucially, this pairwise *KLD* analysis facilitated the detection of "knowledge transfer" events. Knowledge transfer, in this context, describes instances where an element initially distinctive of one discipline in an earlier period subsequently became more characteristic of another. For example, tin, which was distinctive of Chemistry in the early 18th century, clearly shifted to become distinctive of Physics by the late 18th century. Similar shifts were observed for other elements in the early 20th century. Furthermore, elements transitioning from Chemistry to Biology in the 20th century consistently related to biochemical processes, reinforcing the observed disciplinary specialisation and the dynamic nature of scientific knowledge.

## Conclusion and Future Research Directions

![Slide 21](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_21.jpg)

This research successfully employed a *Large Language Model* for the categorisation of articles and the development of refined topic models within a historical corpus. Building upon these *LLM*-generated results, we conducted a comprehensive diachronic analysis of the chemical space across three key disciplines: Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. Furthermore, we performed a detailed interdisciplinary comparison of this evolving chemical landscape, identifying periods of significant disciplinary shift and knowledge transfer. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of scientific discourse and the evolving interconnections between fields over centuries.

Despite these significant achievements, ample scope remains for future work. For the first part of the project, we plan to test alternative *LLMs* and undertake a rigorous evaluation of the current model's outputs to ensure robustness and accuracy. Regarding the diachronic analysis of the chemical space, future efforts will involve a more fine-grained interdisciplinary analysis, potentially incorporating diachronic sliding windows of varying lengths. Expanding the scope to include additional disciplines, such as a comparison between Chemistry and Medicine, also presents a compelling avenue. Finally, exploring the evolution of chemical space using surprisal, a measure of unexpectedness, could yield further insights into the dynamics of scientific discovery and knowledge transfer.
