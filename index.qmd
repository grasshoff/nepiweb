# Preface

This enhanced edition of the AI-NEPI Conference Proceedings contains presentations on Large Language Models for History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science, held April 2-4, 2025, organized by Arno Simons, Adrian Wüthrich, Michael Zichert, all from the ERC Grant project "Network Epistemology in Practice (NEPI)", and Gerd Graßhoff (Humboldt University) at Berlin.

To situate these workshop presentations within an era of rapid technological innovation and to address the workshop's thematic focus on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science, we endeavour with these workshop proceedings to trial an experimental implementation of artificial intelligence in scholarly communication.

The purpose and objective of this proceedings volume is to provide as comprehensive and naturally faithful a representation of the presentations' content as possible. On one hand, we seek to accommodate the temporal pressures of achieving a publication format that is both expeditious and globally accessible through open access, thereby offering the respective presentations of our many authors' current research endeavours an appropriate platform. On the other hand, the protracted duration required for traditional transcription of proceedings contributions into a lengthier textual and multimedia format suitable for the academic community proves so laborious—both for authors and for organisers and editors alike—that the associated lengthy, time-consuming, and meticulous editorial and publishing activities quickly become prohibitive, without ultimately delivering the requisite reporting that scholarly communication demands.

For this reason, we have conceived the figure of the **AI Reporter**. An AI agent embarks upon the apprenticeship of a science correspondent, whose task it is—following the literary, decidedly exaggerated, and somewhat megalomaniacal model of a breakneck reporter working in the sciences, after the manner of Egon Erwin Kisch or the Weltbühne of Jacobsohn, Tucholsky, or Ossietzky—to report upon innovations in the field of AI for the disciplines of history, philosophy, and sociology of science, based upon the presentations submitted by the authors.

We have thus not attempted to transcribe the oral delivery of the respective presentations and present these transcriptions within this proceedings volume. Nor have the authors been required to compose textual contributions in order to create and submit a written form to accompany their presentations. The **AI Reporter** is intended to serve as something akin to an additional science-journalistic companion figure, which, according to models of scholarly communication of content yet to be defined, transforms these into a readable, informative, and trustworthy form of representation.

With this objective, we have, to our knowledge and without being able to draw upon significant AI-related precedents, embarked upon challenges concerning which information from a scholarly presentation, through which processing methods of currently leading technical AI models and corresponding communication concepts, can be rendered into a suitable representational form for this purpose.

The AI model employed for content processing utilises the multimedia information transmission employed in presentations and exploits current AI models in the sense that it represents a conception of interconnected substantive content comprising visual representation and textual oral presentation. The original idea for this processing approach was premised upon a primacy of oral discourse. However, the various informational compositions employed in this volume demonstrated rather quickly that the vast majority of presentations are primarily organised textually according to the arrangement of presentation slides and their content, with accompanying oral exposition and elaborations connecting to this presentational organisational structure. 

One must also consider that presentation techniques can vary considerably depending upon the speaker and authorial organisation. The methods of utilising presentation slides can range from substantive structuring with heading slides accompanied by supplementary or additional slides, through overlay techniques, to film-like sequences of visual content. These variations are similarly rich and style-dependent as different languages, speaking patterns, and forms of articulation. The scope proves surprisingly extensive and rich, rendering the workshop stimulating, diverse, varied, and engaging through these creative possibilities of information transmission. Whilst these enhance interest and attention amongst the audience, they do present considerable demands upon an AI model and the systematic processing of information that extend well beyond mere speech recognition, textual organisation, and reformulation of content positioning.

To accommodate this wealth of variation, the stylistic model has undertaken a certain harmonisation of the contributions. These contributions are not to be confused with oral transcripts or indeed multimedia transcriptions of presentations actually delivered textually and visually in this manner. This is indeed a new textual genre that, based upon the multimedia information provision presented by the authors at the workshop, represents a textually reordered presentation with new arrangement of material in terms of content and organisation. It is an **AI Reportage**.

As a disclaimer, it bears noting at this juncture that whilst AI can already work in an exceedingly functional and validating manner, occasional errors may occur in a manner typical of AI. Such errors are not the responsibility of the presentation authors, but are attributable solely to the creators of the AI models and their technical implementation in the creation of the **AI Reportage**. The AI Reportage model is designed to suppress the proportion of possible hallucination as much as possible, without additional information, RAG techniques, or accompanying literature or supplementary information having been provided by the authors. The content of the respective reportages is processed exclusively through the multimedia transmission of video recording, presentation slides, and oral exposition.

We believe that **AI Reportage** can establish a new genre and offer meaningful contributions to scholarly communication, providing orientation regarding the research content, projects, results, and activities presented. Its value lies in its automatability, speed and multimodality. Abstracts of presentations are often outdated by the time of the event. Video recordings are difficult to skim through for the relevant content. Slides are often not self-explanatory; and transcripts of the spoken word often difficult to read and too informal. The **AI Reportage** takes all these sources into account and merges them into a condensed document facilitating high visibility and accessibility of the presentation content for interested parties.

We are grateful for the insightful and constructive feedback from the presenters and the workshop audience, as well as for the engagement of all colleagues involved in recording and preparing the data. In particular, the contributions of Josias Stelow, Herwig Gerlach, and Paul Oswalt to the implementation, further development, and critical reflection on the AI model were invaluable and played a significant role in the success of this project.
