## Overview {.unnumbered}

Max Neuchel, Andrea Loetgers, and Taya Knulla of Utrecht University have developed *OpenAlex Mapper*, a system designed to visualise and query scientific discourse. Their approach processes large datasets of scholarly articles from OpenAlex, employing advanced dimensionality reduction techniques to map publications into a two-dimensional conceptual space.

The methodology begins by sampling 300,000 English-language articles with well-formed abstracts. The team then embeds these articles using a language model before projecting them via a pre-trained *UMAP* model. A crucial feature of the tool is its ability to accept arbitrary queries to OpenAlex, download the results, and seamlessly integrate these new articles into the existing conceptual map. This function allows for the dynamic exploration of research trends and the conceptual distribution of scientific knowledge, despite a minor technical issue encountered during a live demonstration.

## Project Origins and Data Acquisition

Originating from the theoretical philosophy department at Utrecht University, the *OpenAlex Mapper* project is a collaborative endeavour by Max Neuchel, Andrea Loetgers, and Taya Knulla. The team initiated this work by acquiring a substantial dataset from the OpenAlex database, comprising 300,000 randomly selected articles.

To ensure data quality, the authors applied stringent selection criteria. Each article was required to possess a reasonably well-formed abstract and be published in English, thereby establishing a robust foundation for all subsequent analysis.

## Dimensionality Reduction and Functionality

To process the extensive article dataset, the team employed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (*UMAP*), which effectively reduces the data's dimensionality to two dimensions. This trained *UMAP* model is meticulously retained for consistent application across all operations.

The *OpenAlex Mapper* tool leverages this foundational model whilst enabling users to submit arbitrary queries directly to the OpenAlex database. This architecture facilitates dynamic data retrieval and sophisticated analysis.

## Embedding and Projection Workflow

The workflow for integrating new data into the *OpenAlex Mapper* is meticulously structured. Initially, the tool downloads query results directly from the OpenAlex database. It then embeds these newly acquired articles using the identical language model employed during the initial dataset processing.

Finally, the system projects these embedded representations through the pre-trained *UMAP* model. This procedure ensures a consistent and accurate projection into the established two-dimensional conceptual space.

## Conceptual Mapping and Integration

This systematic process assigns each newly processed article a precise position on the two-dimensional conceptual map. The underlying principle ensures that these positions are determined as if the articles had been an integral part of the original layout.

Such seamless integration allows for a coherent and continuously evolving visualisation of scholarly discourse, thereby maintaining the integrity of the conceptual distribution.

## Demonstration and *UMAP* Features

The inherent features of *UMAP* considerably simplify the integration of new data points into an existing map, streamlining the process significantly. Following the technical explanation, the presenter proceeded with a live demonstration of the *OpenAlex Mapper* tool, aiming to illustrate its functionality in real-time.

## Technical Challenges

Unfortunately, an unforeseen technical issue emerged during the live demonstration, which prevented the tool from operating as intended. This anomaly, which had not been observed during extensive prior testing, was unexpected. Nevertheless, the presenter promptly initiated a second attempt to run the demonstration and resolve the challenge.
