## Overview {.unnumbered}

This presentation introduces a suite of methodological and conceptual tools tailored for research in the History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science (HPSS). The authors begin by delineating the *OpenAlex Mapper* workflow, a system they have developed to navigate and analyse scholarly literature with precision. Their discussion then extends to the application of quantitative methods, such as the *Hopfield Model*, to pressing HPSS research questions.

A central theme is the pivotal role of 'model templates' in scientific discourse. Drawing upon the work of Humphreys (2004) and Knuuttila and Loettgers (2020), the authors define these templates as a structuring discipline for scientific inquiry, particularly illuminating in the context of model transfer between domains. Furthermore, the presentation addresses the challenge of tracing the distribution of concepts across large, interdisciplinary corpora, building on the research of Malaterre, Chartier, and Lareau (2020).

The authors also furnish methods directly relevant to contemporary debates on machine learning and the notion of 'theory-free' science, engaging with contributions from Breiman, Bzdok et al., and Andrews. In the spirit of scholarly transparency, the presentation concludes by candidly acknowledging several qualifications and limitations inherent in the proposed methods, including specific issues with data sources and a particular analytical technique.

## The *OpenAlex Mapper* Workflow

![Slide 12](images/ai-nepi_004_slide_12.png)

The authors introduce the *OpenAlex Mapper*, a structured workflow they have engineered for the systematic analysis of scholarly literature. This system provides a methodical approach to navigating and interpreting vast datasets of academic publications, grounding its methodology in key academic works that inform its design and function.

To facilitate its adoption by the wider research community, the team provides an associated online resource that offers further details and direct access to the tool.

## Quantitative Models in HPSS

The presentation explores the utility of applying quantitative models to research in the History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science. This approach leverages formal methods to analyse historical and philosophical currents within scientific disciplines.

Specifically, the authors adapt the *Hopfield Model* as an exemplary quantitative tool for HPSS inquiries. Their work demonstrates how such models can furnish the field with novel perspectives and enhanced analytical rigour.

## Model Templates as a Structuring Discipline

A core concept the authors examine is that of 'model templates' and their function within scientific debates. They define these templates not merely as predictive instruments but as a structuring discipline that shapes scientific practice, especially concerning the transfer of models between different domains.

This conceptualisation, which builds upon foundational work by Humphreys (2004) and Knuuttila and Loettgers (2020), offers a robust framework for understanding how abstract models are adapted and implemented across the scientific landscape.

## Analysing Concept Distribution

The authors articulate a focused inquiry into the distribution of concepts across vast and interdisciplinary samples of academic texts. This line of investigation seeks to map how specific ideas and terms propagate, evolve, and are utilised in disparate fields of study.

Their approach builds upon the research of Malaterre, Chartier, and Lareau (2020), who have previously explored methods for tracking conceptual dynamics in large-scale corpora.

## Frameworks for Machine Learning Debates

The presentation introduces methods directly relevant to contemporary debates surrounding the role of machine learning in science. These discussions often centre on the prospect of a 'theory-free' scientific practice, where data-driven models might supplant traditional, hypothesis-led inquiry.

The methodological approaches put forward by the authors draw from key contributions by scholars such as Breiman, Bzdok et al., and Andrews, providing analytical tools to engage with these complex and evolving arguments.

## Methodological Limitations

In the interest of scholarly rigour, the authors outline several important qualifications and limitations of the methods under discussion. These acknowledgements highlight potential challenges that may be encountered when applying the framework.

Specifically, they identify known issues with the underlying data sources as a constraint. Furthermore, the presentation points to certain shortcomings within a specific analytical technique employed, thereby suggesting clear avenues for future refinement and development.
