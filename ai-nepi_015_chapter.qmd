## Overview {.unnumbered}
This chapter delves into the multifaceted landscape of quantum gravity research, exploring how diverse scientific efforts converge, or diverge, in the quest for a unified theory. It navigates the concept of 'plural pursuit' within science, particularly examining its manifestation across different scales of analysis. The investigation employs a bottom-up computational approach to reconstruct the research field. Subsequently, these findings undergo comparison with the top-down intuitions of physicists actively working in the domain. Ultimately, the work aims to shed light on the complex interplay between intellectual structures, social communities, and the varying scales at which scientific inquiry operates, promising a nuanced understanding of how science progresses in the face of profound theoretical challenges.

## The Enduring Quest for Quantum Gravity

Fundamental physics confronts a long-standing contemporary issue: the formulation of a quantum theory of gravity. Such a theory seeks to reconcile our understanding of phenomena at the smallest scales with our knowledge of the universe at its largest scales. This challenge has spurred a multitude of attempted solutions, with string theory being amongst the most prominent. However, a considerable number of alternative approaches also exist, reflecting the complexity and depth of the problem.

To account for this situation, where multiple distinct research avenues address a common overarching goal, we introduce the notion of plural pursuit.

## Defining Plural Pursuit

Philosopher Mike Schneider, a collaborator on this project, offers a definition: plural pursuit designates situations in which distinct yet concurrent instances of normal science dedicate themselves to one common problem-solving goal. In the context of this research, that goal is the reconciliation of quantum mechanics and gravitation. Each instance of normal science, it is proposed, articulates through a specific social community tied to an intellectual disciplinary matrix. This concept resonates with established accounts of how research programmes structure themselves, whether explicitly or implicitly.

This framework leads to a critical empirical question: does quantum gravity research itself exemplify plural pursuit? Is the field composed of independent communities, each pursuing different paradigms in parallel towards this shared objective?

## A Bottom-Up Reconstruction of Quantum Gravity Research

To address this empirical question, a bottom-up reconstruction of the research landscape in quantum gravity becomes necessary. This endeavour aims to map not only the linguistic and intellectual structure of the field but also its underlying social structure.

### Data and Analytical Approach

Researchers gathered approximately 228,000 abstracts and titles from the fundamental physics literature, specifically from theoretical physics papers listed on Inspire HEP. The subsequent analysis proceeded in two main stages: reconstructing the intellectual structure through linguistic analysis, followed by an examination of the social structure. For the linguistic analysis, the team employed the BERTopic pipeline.

### The Clustering Pipeline: From Documents to Specialties

The process of intellectual reconstruction begins with the collected documents—the abstracts and titles. These textual data are first spatialised into an embedding space. This step transforms the linguistic content of each document into a numerical representation, capturing semantic relationships.

Following spatialisation, unsupervised clustering algorithms operate on this embedding space. This clustering occurs at a fine-grained level, identifying subtle thematic groupings within the literature. From this, approximately 611 distinct topics emerge. Such a fine-grained approach proves essential because, as subsequent analysis reveals, certain approaches within quantum gravity represent niche areas, perhaps encompassing only a hundred or so papers. Capturing these requires high resolution.

Based on this detailed classification of papers into topics, each physicist can then be assigned a 'specialty'. This specialty corresponds to the most common topic found across their individual publication records. This procedure yields a partition of authors according to the identified linguistic and intellectual structure of the field.

### Social Network Analysis

Complementing the linguistic analysis, a social network analysis uncovers the community structures within the field. This analysis starts with a co-authorship graph. In this graph, nodes represent individual physicists, and edges signify a co-authorship relationship between them. Applying a community detection method to this network, which comprises around 30,000 physicists, reveals approximately 800 distinct communities.

![Diagram illustrating the clustering pipeline.

## The Interplay of Communities and Topics: Defining Plural Pursuit Empirically

With these constructs—topics derived from linguistic analysis and communities from social network analysis—we can refine our understanding of plural pursuit. Intuitively, plural pursuit would manifest as a one-to-one mapping between communities and topics. If represented in a correlation matrix, with communities as rows and topics as columns, an ideal scenario of plural pursuit would show a clear division of labour: each community would dedicate itself almost exclusively to a single topic, resulting in a block-diagonal structure in the matrix.

![Diagram illustrating an ideal community-topic correlation matrix in a configuration of plural pursuit, showing a block-diagonal structure where communities specialise into distinct domains.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_08.jpg)

However, when applying this to the very fine-grained partitions of 800 communities and 611 topics, the resulting correlation matrix appears exceedingly complex and challenging to interpret directly.

![Heatmap showing the npmi (normalised pointwise mutual information) between communities (c) and topics (k), illustrating a complex, non-block-diagonal structure when using fine-grained partitions.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_09.jpg)

Several factors contribute to this complexity. Firstly, the level of fine-graining in the topic partition is somewhat arbitrary. For instance, a broad research programme like string theory might fragment across numerous fine-grained topics. Secondly, micro-social processes also shape communities, meaning large research programmes could be undertaken by several distinct communities in parallel.

## The Scale-Dependency of Scientific Structures

These observations point towards a more profound issue: the computational notions of 'topic' and 'community' are inherently scale-dependent. Literature and social networks can be partitioned at various levels of granularity. This scale-dependency is not merely a technical artefact; it connects to a conceptual reality. Research programmes themselves are often nested. String theory, for example, can be conceptually divided into families and sub-families of research programmes, such as Superstring Theory branching into Type I, Type II, and Heterotic theories, which themselves have further subdivisions.

![Slide illustrating the challenges of fine-graining, the scale-dependent nature of topics and communities, and the nested structure of research programmes exemplified by a hierarchy of string theories.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_10.jpg)

Consequently, identifying instances of plural pursuit demands that we address this ambiguity arising from the choice of scale.

### Hierarchical Clustering Approaches

To manage this scale-dependency, researchers construct hierarchical clusterings for both topics and communities. For topics, an agglomerative clustering technique, such as Ward’s method, merges the initial 600 fine-grained topics iteratively. Topics are combined one by one based on an objective function that seeks to optimise the grouping at each step, building a tree-like structure or dendrogram.

![Dendrogram illustrating Ward agglomerative clustering for topics, showing how fine-grained topics are merged hierarchically.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_11.jpg)

For the community structure, a hierarchical stochastic block model (hSBM) is employed from the outset. This model learns a multi-level partition of the co-authorship network, identifying communities at progressively coarser levels of organisation, as described by Peixoto (2014).

![Diagram illustrating a nested hierarchical stochastic block model for community detection, showing levels from observed network (l=0) to coarser community structures (l=1, l=2, l=3). Figure based on Peixoto 2014.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_12.jpg)

These hierarchical structures for both topics and communities introduce a notion of scale, allowing observation of the system at different levels of coarse-graining. For instance, one can visualise the co-authorship network where each physicist (a dot) is coloured by their specialty, and observe how these specialty patterns change as the linguistic structure is viewed at different levels of topical aggregation. Similarly, the community structure can be examined at various hierarchical levels.

![Visualisation of topics across different hierarchical levels (left) and communities across different hierarchical levels (right), depicted as 3D scatter plots showing layered structures.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_13.jpg)

## An Adaptive Topic Coarse-Graining Strategy

Despite the utility of hierarchical structures, the choice of a specific scale for analysing the relationship between topics and communities remains somewhat arbitrary. The correlation matrix between communities and topics can look vastly different, potentially telling different stories, depending on the selected levels of aggregation for each structure. This presents a significant challenge: which scales are most appropriate for revealing meaningful socio-epistemic configurations?

![A 3x3 grid of heatmaps showing community-topic correlations at different combinations of topic hierarchy levels (L) and community hierarchy levels (l), illustrating the variability of results depending on scale selection.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_14.jpg)

To select an appropriate scale, particularly for topics, an adaptive topic coarse-graining strategy offers a solution. The underlying idea is that whilst the initial fine-grained topics capture many linguistic nuances and conceptual differences, some of these distinctions may have no significant consequences for the social organisation of science—that is, they do not affect how scientists collaborate or form communities. The strategy, therefore, aims to remove degrees of freedom from the fine-grained topic partition (the initial 611 topics) as long as doing so does not discard information useful for understanding the social structure.

This approach relies on an information-theoretic criterion: the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The goal is to find a topic partition that minimises a quantity balancing two needs:

1.  The need for the linguistic partition of the literature to explain the observed social structure of the field (model fit).

2.  The need for the partition itself not to be overly complex or excessively fine-grained (model complexity).

By balancing these two factors, one can navigate the hierarchy of topics. Starting from the detailed 611-topic tree, topics are merged (effectively "zooming out" or coarse-graining) as long as this improves the MDL criterion. The process stops when further merging would lead to too much complexity (or loss of explanatory power) relative to the information gained about the social structure.

Applying this adaptive coarse-graining strategy to the initial 611 topics results in a more manageable set of approximately 50 topics. Crucially, this method preserves certain small-scale linguistic topics if they capture nuances important for understanding the social fabric of the research field. Other topics, however, become lumped together into larger, broader thematic areas. This outcome underscores the necessity of starting with a very fine-grained classification, as some of these minute distinctions indeed matter for discerning the social organisation of science.

![Diagram illustrating the adaptive topic coarse-graining strategy using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion, showing a dendrogram of topics being coarse-grained from 611 initial topics to a smaller set based on balancing model fit and complexity.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_15.jpg)

These 50 resulting topics can then be assigned descriptive labels by retrieving representative N-grams, facilitating their interpretation.

## Reconciling Bottom-Up Structures with Physicists' Intuitions

With a set of coarse-grained topics derived through the adaptive strategy, the analysis can return to the correlation matrix. For each of these resulting topics (columns in the matrix), researchers can attempt to identify the community structure (at various hierarchical levels) that best explains or aligns with that topic.

This process reveals a complex picture. Some topics, particularly very broad ones, may not tie to any specific community, suggesting they represent concepts or tools of general concern across the field. Other topics, however, show strong associations. For instance, topics related to string theory appear to correspond well with a community structure identified at a relatively high level (e.g., the third level) of the community hierarchy. Conversely, other research programmes in quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity, seem to align with communities at much more fine-grained levels of the hierarchy.

Furthermore, the analysis uncovers nested structures and an absence of a perfectly clear division of labour, complicating a simple interpretation of plural pursuit. For example, a smaller community might be part of a larger string theory community yet appear intellectually tied to a distinct but related topic like holography. This indicates that different scales of intellectual and social organisation are often entangled.

![Heatmap showing topics versus best-fit communities, with dendrograms. Coloured boxes highlight specific regions of correlation, illustrating how different topics (e.g., string theory, loop quantum gravity, holography) align with community structures at different hierarchical levels.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_17.jpg)

### The Physicists' Perspective: A Top-Down View

To further enrich this bottom-up reconstruction, the research incorporates the perspectives of physicists themselves. A survey was conducted amongst the founding members of the International Society for Quantum Gravity. Participants were asked to provide a list of quantum gravity approaches that, in their view, structure the overall research landscape.

From this feedback, although not unanimous, a comprehensive list of approaches that partition the field was compiled. This list includes diverse areas such as asymptotic safety, causal sets, dynamical triangulations, group field theory, loop quantum gravity and spin foams, noncommutative geometry, string theory, supergravity, and holography, amongst others. Interestingly, physicists sometimes disagreed on whether certain approaches, like string theory, supergravity, and holography, should be considered entirely separate entities. Some argued that, fundamentally, they all fall under the umbrella of string theory, despite historical and conceptual distinctions.

Based on this expert-generated list of approaches, a supervised machine learning classifier (Support Vector Machine) was trained. Using text embeddings from paper titles and abstracts, and hand-coded labels for a training set, the classifier learned to predict which papers belong to which physicist-defined approach.

![Slide outlining the survey of physicists, the resulting list of quantum gravity approaches, and the training of an SVM classifier to categorise papers according to these top-down approaches.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_19.jpg)

### Comparing Computational Reconstruction with Expert Taxonomies

The predictions from this supervised, top-down classification can then be confronted with the topics identified through the bottom-up, coarse-grained clustering. The comparison reveals that for certain physicist-defined approaches, the correspondence with the computationally derived topics is quite strong. These tend to be approaches that are well-defined and conceptually autonomous.

However, for other approaches, particularly those that are more phenomenological or less developed as full-fledged conceptual frameworks, the match is weaker. A key observation from this comparative analysis concerns the string theory cluster identified in the bottom-up approach. This computationally derived cluster appears to encompass both string theory and supergravity, as defined by the physicists. This finding resonates with the earlier noted ambiguity amongst physicists regarding the separability of these fields.

![Heatmap comparing top-down supervised topics (physicist-defined approaches) on the y-axis with coarse-grained bottom-up topics on the x-axis. The chart shows varying degrees of match, with a notable cluster where string theory and supergravity from the top-down list map onto a combined bottom-up topic.](images/ai-nepi_015_slide_20.jpg)

A quote from one survey respondent encapsulates this sentiment: "I suppose there are a few people still interested in supergravity as a theory in its own right, but I don't think this is a large community. The overlap of people working on supergravity and string theory is so large that I'm not sure the communities can be separated in a meaningful way." This expert intuition aligns with the computational assessment: once linguistic nuances that lack significant impact on the social structure are stripped away via the MDL-guided coarse-graining, string theory and supergravity appear lumped together, even if their initial, fine-grained linguistic clusters rightfully acknowledged conceptual differences.

## Conclusions

This investigation into the structure of quantum gravity research yields several important insights.

Firstly, socio-epistemic systems, comprising both social communities and intellectual frameworks (disciplinary matrices), can be observed at multiple scales. Consequently, the very notions of 'community' and 'disciplinary matrix' are scale-dependent.

Secondly, identifying configurations of plural pursuit—which ideally entail a one-to-one mapping between distinct communities and their unique intellectual substrates—requires a careful matching of these social and intellectual structures across appropriate scales. The inherent scale-dependency complicates any simplistic interpretation.

Thirdly, in the specific case of quantum gravity, a bottom-up, data-driven reconstruction of the research landscape can serve to confirm, and sometimes re-assess, the intuitions held by physicists working within the field. The convergence of computational findings with expert opinion on matters like the relationship between string theory and supergravity provides a compelling example.

Finally, the study underscores a broader point: increasingly powerful computational methods offer new avenues for revisiting and potentially challenging philosophical insights that have long been based on intuition. Concepts such as 'paradigm' or 'community' in complex scientific fields like quantum gravity can now be interrogated with novel empirical tools. To paraphrase Clausewitz, computation emerges as a powerful continuation of philosophical inquiry by other means.
