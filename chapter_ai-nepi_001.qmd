## Workshop Overview {.unnumbered}

The organisers orchestrated a three-day workshop dedicated to exploring the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. This event, held at TU Berlin and accessible online from 2-4 April 2025, garnered considerable interest. Over 50 paper submissions were received, and approximately 220 participants registered, demonstrating the broad appeal of the topic. Adrian Wüthrich, Gerd Graßhoff, Arno Simons, and Michael Zichert meticulously curated the programme, ultimately selecting 16 papers for presentation. The European Research Council's (ERC) *Network Epistemology in Practice* (NEPI) grant (number 10104932) secured the necessary funding for the workshop.

The workshop's conceptualisation stemmed from two distinct yet complementary initiatives. Firstly, the *NEPI* project provided a foundational impetus. Within this framework, Arno Simons pioneered the training of early LLMs on physics texts, whilst Michael Zichert applied these models to analyse conceptual issues in physics. <!-- [Citation needed for pioneering work on LLMs in physics texts] --> Secondly, Gerd Graßhoff, a long-standing collaborator, consistently advocated for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the history and philosophy of science, particularly for scrutinising scientific discovery processes. These converging interests culminated in a unified workshop, fostering broader discussion on AI-assisted methodologies.

The *NEPI* project itself investigates the internal communication dynamics of the *Atlas collaboration* at CERN, the renowned particle physics laboratory. Researchers employ network analysis to map communication structures and utilise semantic tools, including LLMs, to trace the flow of ideas within these complex networks. This endeavour aims to elucidate how large research collaborations collectively generate new knowledge.

Keynote speakers for the workshop included Pierluigi Cassotti and Nina Tahmasebi from the University of Gothenburg. They presented on large-scale text analysis for cultural and societal change, focusing on semantic change detection and data science for the humanities. Iryna Gurevych, head of the *Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing* (UKP) Lab at Technical University Darmstadt, delivered a keynote on elevating Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the cross-document level, covering information extraction, semantic text processing, machine learning, and NLP applications in social sciences and humanities.

Logistical arrangements for the workshop included a comprehensive recording policy. Sessions were captured by a camera focused on the presenter, four microphones, and an iPhone backup. The organisers intend to upload videos of talks, including discussions, to the *NEPI* YouTube channel, subject to presenter consent. A structured Q&A protocol facilitated engagement, limiting questions to four per session to ensure efficiency. Furthermore, an Etherpad/Cryptpad provided an asynchronous platform for comments and questions, whilst the Zoom chat enabled real-time interaction. Ample networking opportunities were provided through scheduled lunch and coffee breaks, a modest reception, and a limited-seat workshop dinner.

## Workshop Engagement

The organisers convened a workshop titled "Large Language Models for the History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science," held from 2-4 April 2025. This event, co-organised by Adrian Wüthrich, Gerd Graßhoff, Arno Simons, and Michael Zichert, welcomed participants both in person at TU Berlin's Room H2005 and via an online platform.

The call for papers generated significant interest, attracting over 50 submissions. From this competitive pool, the organisers meticulously selected 16 papers for presentation during the workshop. Participation levels proved robust: in-person attendance quickly reached capacity, whilst a substantial online audience also registered. Overall, approximately 220 individuals enrolled for the workshop, with additional registrations continuing to arrive. Crucially, the organisers aimed to ensure that all individuals interested in these topics could actively participate in the discussions throughout the two-and-a-half-day programme.

## Genesis and NEPI Objectives

![Slide 02: A Quarto slide titled "Genesis and NEPI Objectives" outlining the two initiatives that led to the workshop and the NEPI project's focus on the Atlas collaboration at CERN.](images/ai-nepi_001_slide_02.jpg)

The workshop's inception stemmed from two distinct yet complementary initiatives. Firstly, the *Network Epistemology in Practice* (NEPI) project provided a foundational impetus. Within this project, Arno Simons pioneered the training of one of the earliest Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically on physics texts, aligning with the project's core interests. <!-- [Citation needed for pioneering work by Arno Simons] --> Concurrently, Michael Zichert, also a member of the *NEPI* team, applied LLMs to scrutinise conceptual issues prevalent in physics.

Secondly, Gerd Graßhoff, a long-standing collaborator of Adrian Wüthrich, significantly contributed to the workshop's genesis. Graßhoff has consistently championed the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the history and philosophy of science, particularly for analysing the intricate processes of scientific discovery. He independently conceived a workshop focused on novel AI-assisted methodologies for these disciplines. Recognising their shared objectives, the organisers subsequently decided to combine their efforts, culminating in the present workshop.

The European Research Council (ERC) grant, *Network Epistemology in Practice* (NEPI), bearing grant number 10104932, provides the funding for this endeavour. Within the *NEPI* project, researchers meticulously study the internal communication of the *Atlas collaboration* at CERN, the prominent particle physics laboratory. This investigation aims to elucidate how one of the largest and most distinguished research collaborations collectively generates new knowledge. Researchers employ network analysis to discern the communication structures within this collaboration. Furthermore, they utilise semantic tools, including LLMs, to trace the flow of ideas throughout these complex network structures. Indeed, the application of LLMs represents a central interest for the project, with numerous other applications anticipated throughout the workshop.

## Recording Protocols

The workshop sessions are currently being recorded. Participants received prior notification of this during the registration process, thereby implying their consent. A single camera captures the presenter, ensuring focus remains on the speaker. For audio capture, four microphones are deployed, supplemented by an iPhone serving as a crucial backup recorder.

Following the workshop, the organisers intend to upload videos of the talks, encompassing the accompanying discussions, to the *NEPI* YouTube Channel. This process, however, necessitates the explicit consent of each presenter. Crucially, whilst discussions are recorded, the audio and video capture solely focuses on the presenter, deliberately excluding the audience. Should any participant require additional information or wish to withdraw their consent, they are encouraged to approach the organisers. Ultimately, these recording efforts aim to establish a comprehensive record of the valuable discussions and presentations from this meeting.

## Interaction Protocols

![Slide 07: A Quarto slide titled "Interaction Protocols" outlining the Q&A format, the use of Etherpad/Cryptpad for asynchronous comments, and Zoom chat for real-time interaction.](images/ai-nepi_001_slide_07.jpg)

Given the substantial number of participants and the constrained time allocated for presentations, the organisers have implemented a specific protocol for questions and comments. Participants are kindly requested to formulate their questions and comments concisely and directly. Following each presentation, the organisers will collect approximately four questions or comments, enabling the presenter to address them collectively, thereby optimising time and avoiding protracted back-and-forth exchanges. The organisers acknowledge that, despite the value of all inquiries, time limitations may preclude addressing every question in person.

To facilitate broader engagement beyond the live sessions, the organisers provide an Etherpad or Cryptpad. This platform allows participants to post comments or questions after sessions, offering presenters an opportunity to read and respond at their convenience. Consequently, this channel ensures continuous interaction even when sessions are not actively running. Furthermore, during live sessions, both online attendees and the in-person audience can utilise the Zoom chat feature to submit questions or comments at any time.

## Networking and Social Programme

Beyond the formal presentations, the workshop actively fosters informal networking amongst researchers and fellows. The programme incorporates ample lunch and coffee breaks, providing dedicated time for casual interaction. Additionally, a modest reception and a workshop dinner are scheduled, though seats for the dinner are strictly limited to confirmed participants.

Coffee and refreshments are available on-site. For lunch and the reception, attendees will proceed to Room H2051, located down the hall and one floor below. The organisers will provide guidance to these locations, for instance, leading participants there after today's final talk.

## Keynote 1: Text Analysis for Societal Change

The first keynote address, titled "Large-scale text analysis for the study of cultural and societal change," featured Pierluigi Cassotti and Nina Tahmasebi from the University of Gothenburg. Nina Tahmasebi serves as the Principal Investigator for the "*Change is Key*" research programme in Gothenburg, whilst Pierluigi Cassotti contributes as a researcher within this project.

These scholars have garnered considerable recognition for their pioneering work in semantic change detection. <!-- [Citation needed for pioneering work by Cassotti and Tahmasebi] --> Their contributions encompass not only technical advancements, such as the development of crucial benchmarks, but also broader methodological considerations concerning the application of data science methods to humanities questions. This dual expertise renders their work exceptionally pertinent to the workshop's themes.

## Keynote 2: Cross-Document NLP

Iryna Gurevych delivered the second keynote address, scheduled for the late afternoon of the following day, under the title "How to InterText? Elevating Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the cross-document level." Gurevych heads the *Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing* (UKP) Lab at Technical University Darmstadt.

Her extensive research primarily focuses on information extraction, semantic text processing, and machine learning. Crucially, her work also explores the practical applications of NLP within the social sciences and humanities. This specific area of expertise positions her contributions as an ideal complement to the workshop's overarching objectives.
