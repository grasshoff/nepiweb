## Overview {.unnumbered}

This chapter documents the logistical arrangements and principal academic contributions of the NEPI workshop. It outlines the event's comprehensive recording policy, which balanced diligent documentation with a firm commitment to presenter consent. The practical arrangements for attendees, from coffee breaks to the main reception, are also detailed to provide a complete record of the proceedings.

At the heart of the workshop were two distinguished keynote addresses. Pierluigi Cassotti and Nina Tahmasebi delivered a presentation on large-scale text analysis, demonstrating its power to reveal cultural and societal change. Subsequently, Iryna Gurevych explored advanced Natural Language Processing techniques for cross-document analysis, highlighting compelling applications for research in the humanities and social sciences.

## Recording and Dissemination

The workshop organisers implemented a clear policy for recording and dissemination, ensuring all sessions conducted via *Zoom* were captured. On-screen reminders and a persistent 'REC' icon served as constant notification, a protocol aligned with the consent participants provided during registration.

The technical arrangement involved a single camera focused on the presenter, with four microphones capturing primary audio. To ensure the integrity of the record, an iPhone provided a secondary audio backup. Following the event, the organisers planned to upload recordings of talks and their subsequent discussions to the NEPI YouTube Channel, contingent upon receiving explicit consent from each presenter. This approach prioritised both open access and the rights of individual speakers, who were encouraged to contact the organisers directly with any concerns.

## Logistics and Social Engagements

The event's logistical arrangements were clearly outlined to guide participants between academic sessions and social gatherings. A slide featuring a communal feast from the *Asterix* comic series playfully established a convivial tone for the hospitality.

Attendees were directed to H 3005 for coffee breaks and refreshments. For more substantial engagements, including lunch and the main reception, the designated venue was H 2051, a space intended to foster broader social interaction amongst all participants.

## Keynote: Analysing Cultural and Societal Change

Pierluigi Cassotti and Nina Tahmasebi from the University of Gothenburg delivered the first keynote, titled 'Large-scale text analysis for the study of cultural and societal change'. Their presentation was built upon the central premise that for their research, 'Change is Key!'

The authors' work centres on semantic change detection, a critical technique for identifying shifts in word meaning across vast textual archives. In their talk, they emphasised the importance of developing robust benchmarks to evaluate analytical methods. Cassotti and Tahmasebi firmly positioned their research within the interdisciplinary field of data science for the humanities, showcasing how computational approaches can address profound questions of cultural evolution.

## Keynote: Cross-Document NLP

In the second keynote, Iryna Gurevych presented her work on elevating Natural Language Processing (*NLP*) to a cross-document level. Her talk, 'How to InterText?', signalled a move beyond the analysis of single texts to more complex, interconnected information landscapes.

Affiliated with the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (*UKP*) Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Gurevych's research integrates information extraction, semantic text processing, and machine learning. Through her work, she demonstrates compelling applications of these advanced *NLP* techniques, building a vital bridge between computational linguistics and the nuanced research questions posed by the social sciences and humanities.
