## Overview {.unnumbered}

This workshop emerges from the confluence of two primary initiatives. The first is the 'Network Epistemology in Practice' (NEPI) project, within which Arno Simons has pioneered the training of large language models on physics texts, whilst Michael Zichert has explored their application to conceptual problems in physics. The second originates with Gerd Graßhoff, a key cooperation partner who has long championed the use of artificial intelligence in the history and philosophy of science, particularly for analysing processes of scientific discovery.

Representing a fusion of these intellectual currents, the workshop is supported by an ERC grant awarded to the NEPI project. The project's central objective is to investigate the internal communication of the ATLAS collaboration at CERN. To this end, the team employs network analysis to map the collaboration's communication structures and uses advanced semantic tools, including large language models, to trace the flow of ideas across these networks.

The organisation of this event was expertly managed by Svenja Goetz, Lea Stengel, and Julia Kim. Essential technical support was provided by Oliver Ziegler and his *Unicam* team.

## Recording and Dissemination

![Slide 02](images/ai-nepi_001_slide_02.png)

A comprehensive recording protocol is in place for all workshop sessions to ensure a high-quality record of the proceedings. The technical arrangement, managed by Oliver Ziegler and the *Unicam* team, comprises a primary camera focused on the active speaker, four microphones to capture audience contributions, and an iPhone as a backup audio recorder. This configuration also facilitates a seamless experience for remote attendees joining via *Zoom*.

Following the workshop, and with the explicit consent of the presenters, recordings of the talks and subsequent discussions will be made publicly available on the NEPI project's YouTube channel. Participants consented to this policy upon registration and are welcome to contact the organisers with any queries.

## Participant Interaction

To foster productive dialogue, the workshop follows a structured protocol for interaction. During question-and-answer sessions, attendees are requested to formulate their questions concisely. The session chair will gather a small group of questions before inviting the presenter to offer a collective response, a method that streamlines the exchange of ideas.

For discussions that extend beyond the live sessions, a shared *Etherpad* (or *CryptPad*), accessible via a QR code, provides an asynchronous forum. This platform enables participants to post comments and questions in dedicated sections for each presentation. The *Zoom* chat also remains available for commentary throughout the event. Furthermore, the programme features a dedicated discussion session on the second day to explore common themes, complemented by generous breaks and social events designed to encourage informal networking.

## Keynote: Semantic Change and Data Science

![Slide 05](images/ai-nepi_001_slide_05.png)

The first keynote address, delivered by Pierluigi Cassotti and Nina Tahmasebi from the University of Gothenburg, will explore large-scale text analysis for the study of cultural and societal change. Nina Tahmasebi leads the 'Change is Key!' research programme, to which Pierluigi Cassotti contributes as a researcher. Their collective work has made significant contributions to the field of semantic change detection.

Their research is notable for its dual focus, spanning not only technical innovations such as the development of evaluation benchmarks but also the broader application of data science methodologies to address complex questions within the humanities. This perspective resonates strongly with the workshop's interdisciplinary aims. For logistical arrangements, coffee breaks will be held in the main venue, whilst lunch and the evening reception will take place in room H2051.

## Keynote: Cross-Document NLP

The second keynote will be delivered by Professor Iryna Gurevych, who leads the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt. Her presentation, titled *How to InterText? Elevating NLP to the cross-document level*, will delve into advanced natural language processing techniques.

Professor Gurevych’s research concentrates on information extraction, semantic text processing, and machine learning. A defining feature of her work is the application of these computational methods to generate new insights within the social sciences and humanities, an approach that aligns closely with the interdisciplinary objectives of this workshop.
