## Overview {.unnumbered}
This chapter details an investigation into the evolution of scientific English and associated academic phenomena, such as knowledge transfer and the identification of influential research contributions. The project harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the metadata of historical scientific texts. Subsequently, it analyses the chemical space within these texts across different disciplines and time periods, aiming to identify moments of significant interdisciplinarity and knowledge exchange.

## Objectives of the Investigation

The investigation unfolds in two primary phases. The first phase explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to refine and expand the metadata associated with historical scientific articles. This involves categorising articles by scientific discipline, assigning semantic tags to denote topics, and generating abstractive summaries. The second phase delves into an analysis of the chemical space as it evolves over time within various disciplines. A key goal here is to pinpoint periods characterised by heightened interdisciplinarity and the transfer of knowledge between fields.

## The Historical Corpus: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society

To explore these objectives, the research utilises the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. This journal, first published in 1665, stands as the oldest scientific journal in continuous publication and maintains a high reputation to this day. Its historical significance is profound; it played a crucial role in shaping scientific communication, notably through establishing peer-reviewed paper publication as a primary means for disseminating scientific knowledge.

### Influential and Curious Contributions

The corpus contains numerous influential contributions. For instance, in the 17th century, it featured Isaac Newton's new theory concerning light and colours. The 18th century saw publications such as Benjamin Franklin's account of his electrical kite experiment. Later, in the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell's descriptions of electromagnetic fields appeared within its pages.

Beyond these seminal works, the journal also includes papers of a more speculative or curious nature. An example includes "Monsieur Auzout's Speculations of the Changes, likely to be difcovered in the Earth and Moon, by their refpective Inhabitants," which discusses the potential for observing lunar inhabitants. The project's focus, however, remains not on fact-checking or assessing the scientific validity of such historical papers, but rather on analysing linguistic and thematic evolution.

## Corpus Characteristics and Existing Metadata

The specific dataset employed is the Royal Society Corpus (RSC) version 6.0. This comprehensive collection spans over three centuries of scientific communication, from 1665 to 1996, encompassing nearly 48,000 texts and amounting to almost 300 million tokens.

The corpus already possesses a degree of encoded metadata, including attributes such as author, century of publication, year, and volume. Previous research efforts utilised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling to infer field-of-research categories and classify the papers. However, the resulting categories from LDA tended to conflate disciplines, sub-disciplines, and text types (e.g., observations, reporting). A primary motivation for the current project is to leverage LLMs to enhance this existing metadata, aiming for more granular and accurate categorisation.

## Part I: LLMs for Metadata Enrichment

The initial phase of this research concentrates on employing LLMs to enrich the metadata of the historical texts. This endeavour seeks to improve several aspects of information management and knowledge organisation.

![Section title: Part I â€“ LLMs for metadata enrichment.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_11.jpg)

### Objectives for LLM Application in Information Management

LLMs offer potential for various enhancements. These include text clean-up, particularly relevant for OCR-processed historical documents. Further applications involve generating summaries for easier content access, improving information retrieval mechanisms, facilitating more precise information extraction, and enabling robust categorisation of articles. Ultimately, these enriched metadata can serve as a foundation for constructing knowledge graphs.

![Conceptual diagram showing LLM applications for information management, including text clean-up, summarisation, categorisation, and knowledge graph creation.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_12.jpg)

### Experimental Setup with Llama 3

Historical texts, often written in an older linguistic style and presenting complex syntax, pose challenges for traditional analysis. For instance, an article titled "A spot in one of the belts of Jupiter" requires careful reading to discern its core contributions. To address these challenges and achieve hierarchical categorisation (discipline and sub-discipline), generate index terms, and produce concise "Too Long; Didn't Read" (TL;DR) summaries, the project selected Llama 3.

Specifically, experiments utilised Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B, an 8-billion parameter model. This particular variant, fine-tuned for instruction following, excels at producing structured output, such as JSON or YAML, which is crucial for systematic metadata generation. Llama 3 models, accessible via Hugging Face, generally offer improved performance over predecessors like Llama 2 and other models such as Mistral.

### Prompt Engineering for an LLM-Librarian

Crafting an effective prompt was essential for guiding the LLM. The system prompt instructed the LLM to adopt the persona of a librarian tasked with organising the collection of historical scientific articles from the Royal Society of London, covering publications between 1665 and 1996.

![LLM prompt: Role definition as a librarian organising Royal Society articles (1665-1996).](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_16.jpg)

The prompt further detailed the nature of the input: instances from the digitised dataset, comprising OCR-extracted text and existing metadata (title, author, date, etc.). Potential issues with OCR quality were also acknowledged. Four specific tasks were then outlined for the LLM:

![LLM prompt: Input description (digitised articles) and Task A (analyse and suggest alternative title).](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_17.jpg)

The first task (A) required the LLM to read and analyse each article to understand its content and context, then suggest an alternative title that better reflected its core subject.

Task B involved writing a concise TL;DR summary of three to four sentences, capturing the article's essence and main findings in simple language, accessible to a high school student. Task C directed the LLM to identify exactly five main topics for each article, conceptualised as keywords suitable for categorising the text into scientific sub-fields.

![LLM prompt: Task B (write TL;DR summary) and Task C (identify five main topics).](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_18.jpg)

Task D focused on hierarchical classification. The LLM needed to identify the primary scientific discipline from a predefined list of nine categories (Physics, Chemistry, Environmental & Earth Sciences, Astronomy, Biology & Life Sciences, Medicine & Health Sciences, Mathematics & Statistics, Engineering & Technology, Social Sciences & Humanities). This list drew upon insights from the earlier LDA topic modelling. Crucially, the LLM was then asked to determine a suitable second-level sub-discipline, without a predefined list, allowing for more flexible and emergent categorisation. The prompt specified that the sub-discipline must be a branch of the primary discipline and not one of the other primary disciplines.

![LLM prompt: Task D (identify primary discipline from list and a sub-discipline).](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_19.jpg)

To further guide the LLM, an example input was provided, featuring an article by Isaac Newton with a characteristically long title and a text snippet.

![LLM prompt: Example input for an Isaac Newton article, showing metadata and text snippet.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_21.jpg)

An example of the desired output structure was also implicitly conveyed, illustrating how a revised, simpler title (e.g., "A New Theory of Light and Colors"), relevant topics, a TL;DR summary, and the scientific discipline/sub-discipline (e.g., Physics/Optics and Light) should be formatted. Finally, the prompt explicitly instructed the LLM to ensure its output was a valid YAML file, with no additional text, and offered a notional reward for adherence.

![LLM prompt: Final instruction for output to be a valid YAML file.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_22.jpg)

### Initial Results and LLM Performance

Initial sanity checks on the LLM's output yielded promising results. A high proportion, 99.81% (17,486 out of 17,520), of the generated outputs were in a valid YAML format, indicating the model's strong adherence to structural requirements. Furthermore, 94% of the predicted primary scientific disciplines fell within the predefined set of nine.

Some deviations, or 'hallucinations', occurred. For instance, the LLM occasionally returned "Earth Sciences" instead of the specified "Environmental & Earth Sciences". In other cases, it invented novel categories like "Music". Analysis of these deviations revealed instances where the LLM misinterpreted numerical indices from the prompt (e.g., "3. Environmental & Earth Sciences") as part of the category name itself. Some generated categories, such as "Neurology" or "Zoology", were more appropriate as sub-disciplines rather than primary disciplines. Despite these minor issues, the vast majority of papers received correct primary discipline assignments.

![Key statistics on LLM output: 99.81% valid YAML, 94% disciplines within set, with examples of minor errors.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_23.jpg)

The distribution of articles across the LLM-assigned disciplines shows a concentration in Biology & Life Sciences, Physics, and Chemistry, followed by Engineering and Technology, and Environmental and Earth Sciences. Other disciplines represent smaller proportions of the corpus.

### Discipline Analysis Over Time

An analysis of the LLM-assigned disciplines across the Royal Society articles over time reveals interesting trends. Until the close of the 18th century, the distribution of articles across disciplines appears relatively homogeneous. A notable peak in chemistry articles emerges towards the end of the 18th century, coinciding with the Chemical Revolution. Following this period, chemistry establishes itself as a central pillar within the Royal Society's publications. Progressing from the 19th century into the 20th, three disciplinesâ€”Biology, Physics, and Chemistryâ€”become particularly prominent.

![Stacked area chart illustrating the changing proportions of scientific disciplines in Royal Society articles from 1670 to 1990.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_26.jpg)

Preliminary analysis using t-SNE projection on the LLM-generated summaries offers a spatial representation of disciplinary relationships across the entire corpus. This visualisation indicates overlaps between Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, with Chemistry often positioned centrally. Disciplines such as Humanities, Astronomy, and Mathematics tend to form more isolated clusters. Future work could extend this t-SNE analysis diachronically to observe shifts and evolving overlaps between disciplines through different historical periods.

## Part II: Diachronic Analysis of the Chemical Space

The second part of the research leverages the LLM-defined disciplines for a diachronic analysis of the chemical space, presented by Sergei. This analysis focuses on the three most prevalent disciplines in the corpus: Chemistry, Biology, and Physics.

![Section title: Part II â€“ Diachronic Analysis of the Chemical Space.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_27.jpg)

### Methodology for Chemical Space Analysis

A crucial first step involved extracting chemical terms from the articles. For this, researchers employed ChemDataExtractor, a Python module designed for the automatic identification of chemical substances. An iterative approach to extraction proved beneficial: an initial pass over the full texts yielded considerable noise. Consequently, a second application of ChemDataExtractor to the initially extracted list of substances helped to refine the results and reduce erroneous identifications. The overall workflow involved LLM document classification followed by chemical term extraction, leading to divergence analyses.

![Workflow diagram: RSC data to LLM classification, then ChemDataExtractor, then Kullback-Leibler Divergence analysis.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_28.jpg)

### Kullback-Leibler Divergence for Change Detection

Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), a measure of relative entropy, served as the analytical tool to detect changes in the chemical space over time. KLD quantifies how one probability distribution differs from a second, reference probability distribution; higher divergence indicates greater difference. This project applied KLD in two principal ways.

Firstly, KLD facilitated an independent analysis of each discipline (Chemistry, Physics, Biology), tracing the evolution of its chemical space. This involved comparing a 20-year period before a given date with the 20-year period after it, then advancing this window by five years along the timeline. This sliding window approach allowed for the tracking of changes within each discipline's chemical vocabulary.

Secondly, KLD enabled pairwise comparisons between disciplinesâ€”specifically, Chemistry versus Physics, and Chemistry versus Biology. These comparisons were based on 50-year periods.

![Explanation of Kullback-Leibler Divergence: concept, formula, and its application to compare chemical space evolution within and between disciplines.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_30.jpg)

### Evolution of Chemical Space within Disciplines

The KLD analysis per discipline reveals broadly similar trends across Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, with peaks and troughs in divergence occurring at roughly contemporaneous periods. Towards the later end of the timeline, these KLD plots tend to flatten, suggesting a decrease in the rate of change in chemical vocabulary within each discipline.

![Line graph of KLD over time for Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, highlighting a late 18th-century peak.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_31.jpg)

Focusing on the notable KLD peak in the late 18th century (approximately 1776-1816), an examination of the specific chemical substances driving this divergence shows that, for Biology and Physics, one or two substances often exhibit extremely high KLD values, disproportionately influencing the change. Interestingly, during this period, many of the same key substances appear across all three disciplines.

![Line charts of top chemical substances' KLD in Chemistry, Biology, and Physics (1776-1816).](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_32.jpg)

This picture changes significantly when observing a later period, such as the second half of the 19th century (1851-1896). Here, the range of influential substances in Biology and Physics becomes more diverse, and their individual contributions to KLD are more uniform. Thematic shifts also become apparent: Biology's chemical vocabulary begins to reflect a move towards biochemistry. In contrast, Chemistry and Physics show increased focus on noble gases and radioactive elements, many of which were discovered towards the end of the 19th century.

![Line charts of top chemical substances' KLD in Chemistry, Biology, and Physics (1851-1896), indicating thematic shifts.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_33.jpg)

### Interdisciplinary Comparisons and Knowledge Transfer

Pairwise KLD comparisons between disciplines further illuminate these evolving relationships. Word clouds representing distinctive chemical terms for Chemistry versus Biology in the latter half of the 20th century, for example, show Biology's vocabulary rich in substances related to biochemical processes in living organisms. Chemistry's distinctive terms, meanwhile, lean towards organic chemistry, featuring hydrocarbons and benzene. A comparison of Physics versus Chemistry reveals a greater prevalence of metals, noble gases, rare earth metals, semi-metals, and radioactive elements within Physics' distinctive chemical lexicon during certain periods. These analyses help to identify thematic divergences between disciplines.

![Word clouds showing KLD-ranked distinctive chemical terms in pairwise comparisons of Chemistry, Physics, and Biology.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_34.jpg)

Intriguingly, pairwise KLD comparisons also enable the detection of potential knowledge transfer. This phenomenon occurs when a chemical term, initially distinctive to one discipline (e.g., Chemistry), later becomes more characteristic of another (e.g., Biology or Physics). For instance, analysis of tin's distinctiveness shows it as characteristic of Chemistry in the first half of the 18th century, before shifting to become more distinctive of Physics in the latter half. Similar shifts are observable for other elements at different times, such as elements related to biochemical processes becoming more distinctive of Biology in the 20th century after initially being more associated with Chemistry.

## Conclusion

This research successfully demonstrates the utility of Large Language Models for enhancing the categorisation and topic modelling of historical scientific texts within the Royal Society Corpus. Building upon these LLM-generated classifications, a diachronic analysis of the chemical space across Chemistry, Biology, and Physics has yielded insights into disciplinary evolution and interdisciplinary dynamics. The methods employed reveal shifts in chemical vocabularies over centuries and highlight periods of significant change and potential knowledge transfer.

## Future Work

Whilst the initial findings are promising, several avenues for future work can refine and extend this research.

![Future work points: testing other LLMs, evaluating results, more detailed chemical space analysis, and including more disciplines.](images/ai-nepi_018_slide_37.jpg)

Concerning the LLM applications (Part I), further endeavours include:

*   Rigorous evaluation of the Llama 3 model's output against ground truth or expert-annotated data.
*   Comparative analysis by testing other LLMs to assess relative performance and robustness.
*   Addressing the historical nuances of terminology; for example, early chemical terms (e.g., 'latent heat', alchemical terms) may require specialised handling or integration with historical ontologies to ensure accurate interpretation by LLMs and tools like ChemDataExtractor. This includes managing spelling variations prevalent in historical texts, deciding whether to normalise them or analyse their evolution.
*   Investigating the potential of incorporating knowledge graphs or ontologies not just as an output, but also as an input to provide LLMs with richer contextual understanding for classification tasks.

For the diachronic analysis of the chemical space (Part II), future directions involve:

*   Conducting more fine-grained interdisciplinary analyses, experimenting with different lengths of diachronic sliding windows and comparison periods. This could include asynchronous comparisons to detect delays or leads in how chemical space evolves across different disciplines.
*   Expanding the analysis to include more disciplines, for instance, comparing Chemistry with Medicine, to broaden the understanding of interdisciplinary interactions.
*   Tracing the evolution of chemical space using surprisal metrics, offering an alternative perspective on linguistic and conceptual change.
*   A thorough assessment of the ChemDataExtractor's recall for historical chemical terms, potentially using resources like CAS numbers to build comprehensive lists of historical nomenclature.
*   Investigating sharp shifts in disciplinary distributions, such as the one observed around 1800 for Chemistry, to determine if they are genuine reflections of scientific revolutions or potential artefacts of changing terminology or classification schemes.

Additionally, documenting computational infrastructure and processing times for corpus-wide analyses will be valuable for reproducibility and for informing similar large-scale historical text mining projects.
